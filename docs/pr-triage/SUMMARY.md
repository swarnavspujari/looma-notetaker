# Community PR triage — Ian Sumner's #25–#30, #34

Integration branch: `integration/ian-prs` (off `main` @ 16f27a8 / v1.2.3).
Each accepted PR is a real merge of the contributor's commits followed by
`fix:`/`test:` remediation commits; every step passed the full gate
(`cargo fmt --check`, `clippy --workspace --all-targets` zero warnings,
`cargo test -p fly-app -p fly-asr`, `tsc --noEmit`, eslint, and — once added —
`npm test` vitest) and a fresh-context re-review.

Merge order: #34 → #27 → #29 → #28 → #30, then the diagnostics work item.
Separate branch: `feat/managed-mac-whisper-rehost` (supersedes #26).

| PR | Verdict | One-liner |
|---|---|---|
| #34 | **merge** | model-dropdown-overrides-tier hint; fixed styling + wording |
| #27 | **merge** | macOS Metal→CPU guarded fallback; extended to the Groq-fallback and live paths |
| #29 | **merge** | batch transcription progress; fmt, notice-clobber and em-dash fixes, tests |
| #28 | **merge** | resilient downloads; checksum-skip, mirror disclosure/opt-out, live single-attempt |
| #30 | **merge** | actionable engine/download notices; 9 fixes + vitest + dev-mock QA |
| #25 | **close as superseded** | #30 contains and extends it (same feature, more complete) |
| #26 | **reject, supersede** | sound design, but the binary must be maintainer-built and repo-hosted → `feat/managed-mac-whisper-rehost` |

## PR #34 — model dropdown overrides hardware tier (hint)

- **Fixed:** stray `marginTop: -4` (peer helper texts have none); hint now
  also names the "Maximum quality" checkbox (verified:
  `default_model_for_tier(tier, max_quality)` is only consulted when no
  override is set — pipeline.rs); re-review caught that "settings above"
  misdirected (the checkbox is *below* the hint) — word dropped.
- **Known simplification (documented, not fixed):** on the Cloud tier the
  chosen model only configures the local *fallback* engine (Groq still
  transcribes); the hint doesn't spell that out. Acceptable for helper text.
- **Tests:** none needed (copy + style only). Verified in dev-mock QA.

## PR #27 — Metal→CPU fallback on macOS

- **Merged mechanism (sound):** Metal runs as a guarded primary with a
  forced-CPU (`-ng`) sibling, mirroring the Windows Vulkan guard; a runtime
  failure pins the machine+model to CPU (`gpu::record_runtime_failure`),
  toggling the GPU switch off→on clears the pin.
- **Fixed (same bug class):**
  - Groq path's local fallback ignored the stored CPU pin (`force_cpu:
    !use_gpu`); it now honors the pin via extracted
    `cpu_pinned_for_model`/`local_fallback_force_cpu`, and on macOS always
    forces CPU — it is the last engine in the chain, and an unpinned machine
    may be exactly the one whose Metal init aborts (re-review finding, fixed).
  - live.rs built its engine with `force_cpu: false` — live captions actually
    ran on Metal on macOS, contradicting MODELS.md; now
    `cfg!(target_os = "macos")` forces `-ng` (Windows invocation unchanged).
  - The mangled "because on GPUs Metal can't serve…" sentence fixed in both
    MODELS.md and the code comment.
- **Tests:** `pinned_cpu_verdict_forces_cpu_on_groq_fallback_path` (real
  Storage round-trip through `gpu::record_runtime_failure`).
- **Mac-unverified:** the `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` block cannot compile
  on this machine — desk-checked (and pattern-replicated under `rustc --cfg`
  by the re-reviewer); behavior is on the smoke checklist.

## PR #29 — transcription progress ("your microphone (42%)")

- **Merged logic (correct):** speech-milliseconds accounting over VAD batch
  plans; `TranscribeProgress` + default-method plumbing through
  `TranscriptionEngine` and `GuardedAsr`.
- **Fixed:** the PR's own lines failed `cargo fmt --check`; the fallback
  engine's immediate 0% event clobbered the "GPU transcription failed —
  continuing on CPU" notice ~1 s after it appeared (suppressed — progress
  resumes with the first completed batch, and only in the failover arm: a
  later channel still shows 0%); "Transcribing — your microphone — 42%"
  double em-dash (detail is now "your microphone (42%)"); silent recordings
  no longer emit a 0/0 event.
- **Tests:** `progress_is_monotonic_and_ends_at_exactly_total`,
  `silent_recording_yields_no_progress_points` (via extracted
  `cumulative_progress`, testable without a whisper-cli binary).

## PR #28 — resilient model downloads

- **Merged (verified):** SHA-256 enforced per attempt regardless of source;
  hf-mirror.com tried only after huggingface.co fails twice;
  `best_installed_asr_model` fallback so an offline machine with weights on
  disk still transcribes.
- **Fixed:** checksum mismatch now skips the source instead of re-downloading
  it (was: up to 4 full downloads from a deterministically-corrupt source;
  now: at most 1 wasted download per source); the producer error string and
  the predicate share `CHECKSUM_MISMATCH_PREFIX` so a reword can't decouple
  them; hf-mirror.com disclosed in MODELS.md (community-run HF proxy operated
  from China; integrity bounded by the pins) with a `FLYONTHEWALL_NO_HF_MIRROR`
  opt-out checked in `candidate_urls` — **default remains mirror-on; the
  maintainer may want to reverse that default** (flagging per instruction);
  live captions use `DownloadEffort::SingleAttempt` so offline users get
  `live:status = unavailable` promptly instead of after ~12 s of retries;
  the installed-model-fallback notice uses display names and no em-dash.
- **Tests:** `candidate_urls_opt_out_disables_mirror`,
  `checksum_mismatch_advances_to_next_source` (+ the PR's own
  `candidate_urls_mirror_only_for_hf`, `best_installed_prefers_largest`).
- **Known gaps (documented, out of remediation scope):**
  - The "X unavailable, transcribing with installed Y" stage detail is
    overwritten by the next stage emit almost immediately — effectively
    logs-only. A persistent-notice mechanism would be its real fix.
  - Pre-existing (kept by the rewrite, inherited from main): concurrent
    `ensure()` calls for the same artifact share one temp file and hash the
    network stream, not the disk file — two simultaneous downloads can
    install corrupt bytes. Flagged as a follow-up task.

## PR #30 — actionable engine/model-download errors + Groq escape hatch

Contains #25 (see below). All nine findings fixed:

1. Notice selection extracted to pure `selectPipelineNotice`/`briefError`
   (frontend/src/pipelineNotice.ts), keyed on the error CONTENT
   ("whisper-cli is not installed" from `ensure_tool`) — Groq failures and
   download errors are no longer mislabeled as engine-missing.
2. Failed in-app engine installs surface inside EngineMissingNotice
   (`installError`); additionally App.tsx tags install errors
   ("engine install failed: …") so non-download failures (e.g. extraction)
   keep the actionable notice (re-review finding, fixed).
3. Groq CTA deep-links to a "groq" Settings focus: Technical forced, Groq
   card rendered even before the toggle is on, scrolled into view.
4. Re-transcription banner applies the same URL-strip/brief treatment.
5. Models-list filter matches `whisper-bin` exactly — `whisper-bin-vulkan`
   is visible again on Windows.
6. `find_on_path` probes `/opt/homebrew/bin` and `/usr/local/bin` on macOS
   (Finder-launched apps don't inherit brew's PATH).
7. devMock gained `engine_installed`/`engine_managed` (+ QA toggles,
   `fotwMockEmit` event hook, a vulkan mock entry).
8. GroqHint is a real `<button>` (keyboard-reachable) styled as a text link.
9. `installEngine` clears only its own `model:progress` entry.

- **Tests:** minimal vitest setup (`npm test`), 12 pure-logic tests over
  notice selection and error briefing.
- **Dev-mock QA:** all nine notice/deep-link/progress states verified in the
  port-1420 dev-mock — see `pr-30-devmock-qa.md` (DOM evidence; the sandboxed
  browser's screenshot capture was broken this session, noted there).
- **Known minor (documented):** on a fresh offline machine the first failure
  is the sherpa download (ensured before whisper), so the engine notice's
  surfaced error text names sherpa — the engine genuinely is missing and the
  CTA is right, but the mixed messaging is worth knowing. Settings' engine
  row doesn't know about an install started from the transcript notice
  (second entry point to the pre-existing concurrent-download hazard above).

## PR #25 — close as superseded

#30 is a strict superset of #25's "engine not installed" flow (readiness
flags, notice, install path) with the download-failure and Groq-CTA work on
top. Nothing in #25 is lost by closing it; credit goes in the close note.

## PR #26 — reject and supersede (`feat/managed-mac-whisper-rehost`)

- **Why rejected:** the artifact URL points at the contributor's fork and a
  binary only he built. Everything the app auto-downloads and executes must
  be maintainer-built and repo-hosted (same policy as the Windows Vulkan
  build) — this is a provenance/hosting decision, not a code-quality one.
  The design itself (managed engine artifact + PATH-first resolution) is
  right and is credited.
- **Supersede branch (compiles; deliberately fails closed):** pr/26 merged,
  then: build script pins the whisper.cpp COMMIT and asserts it, fixes the
  shallow-tag reuse path, pins CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0 (the app's
  minimumSystemVersion), adds GGML_NATIVE=OFF for macOS, hard-asserts
  `lipo -archs` == "x86_64 arm64"; a `workflow_dispatch` GitHub workflow
  (macOS runner) builds, emits the pin, and — gated on a `create_release`
  input — attaches the tarball to a `tools-whisper-v1.9.1` release of this
  repo; models.rs keeps the entry structure with the canonical-repo URL and
  a deliberately invalid placeholder SHA the maintainer replaces with the
  workflow's emitted pin. MODELS.md corrected (real ~2.4 MB size, Linux row
  removed, honest "pending" status). Steps: `pr-26-rehost-checklist.md`
  (on that branch).
- **Re-review catch (fixed on the branch):** the PR's tar packaging line used
  GNU-only `--owner/--group` flags — macOS's bsdtar 3.5.x rejects them, so
  under `set -e` the script died right after a successful compile, on the CI
  runner and local Macs alike (the author presumably had GNU tar installed).
  Now branched per target (`--uid/--gid` on macOS).
- **The arm64 slice has never been executed by anyone** — the checklist
  makes both smoke tests explicit.

## Diagnostics work item (integration branch)

Rolling file logs under `<data dir>/logs` (daily, 5-file cap,
tracing-appender, blocking writes so panic lines reach disk), a startup line
with app version + OS/arch, a panic hook (message + location, then the
default hook), and Settings → Technical → "Open logs folder"
(`reveal_logs_dir`). Ordering hazard handled: the legacy-Looma data-dir
migration runs before the logs dir is created (`state::prepared_data_dir`).
No telemetry; nothing leaves the machine. Tests:
`rolling_appender_writes_into_logs_dir`, `payload_str_extracts_both_panic_shapes`.

## What remains mac-unverified (see mac-smoke-checklist.md)

Everything inside `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` and every macOS runtime
behavior: the Metal guarded fallback + CPU pinning, the Groq-fallback forced
CPU, live captions on `-ng`, brew-path probing, the managed-engine download
(rehost branch, blocked on the artifact), and the log folder on macOS. The
Windows-visible surface (notices, Settings, progress text, downloads,
diagnostics) was verified here via tests + dev-mock QA.
